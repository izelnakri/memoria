check delete and unload interface tests & implementation for relationship references

Design decisions:
1- Should we always return a RelationshipPromise when instance.relationship gets accessed(?) - Current we dont for DX. This might also conflict with BelongTo setting logic. in-memory cache lookup only happens after remote call
 - making it automatic has to be done on built() but might go against the idea of making everything lazy. Remote lookup needs a promise and non peek cache lookup has to happen AFTER remote lookup.
 - this makes relationship .reload() not possible

2- let insertedGroup = await MemoryGroup.insert(group); when group has a photo, it doesnt get transferred to insertedGroup.photo because
3- fetchRelationship always returns new instance when record is found(this means .peek() as well for MemoryAdapter).
4- get fetchedRelationships() {} check the relationshipCache, when null values are not stored this is wrong?!? No keep going on with this logic

// never use propEqual due to recursion inside instances on sql(probably many-to-many bug)

- instance metadata feature:
  - index
  - reason
  - source
  - host
  - origin
  - originator_id
  - builtAt
  - [extraData]

email will not be reflexive to user until insert(?) if user also fetched email in this scenario:

deleteInArray / change / addInArray (should be proxied correctly when reference diff different)

changing instance/array (can be proxied for primaryKeyChange)

# let ServerPhoto = Object.assign(Object.create({}), Photo);
# Object.setPrototypeOf(ServerPhoto, Photo);

# Check reflexive relationships, readonly nested data, updating from both sides(_id, relationship and inverse relationship, creating new record relationship updates)

# add ember-concurrency like primitives with a new Promise-like interface for .retry(), .abort() [particularly interesting for async relationships]
# maybe apply this to all async functions, after config->store refactor

# Post /photos(should not have owner embedded by default on REST) but after post should still keep the reference

# DirtyState(isLoaded, hasAllRelationshipsLoaded, persistedAt, loadedAt)
# add benchmark setup
# Removing a relationship form an array
# store.findAll() returns a PromiseArray that fulfills to a RecordArray and store.peekAll directly returns a RecordArray.
# RecordArray implements MutableArray: https://api.emberjs.com/ember/release/classes/MutableArray
# <C-n> <C-p> to jump hunks, zo, zc
# build() -> most basic building block(essentialy new() with tracking and provided values) and seals or locks. Always creates a revision

=======================================
Interesting ember-data modules to check:

DS.Store = Store;
DS.PromiseArray = PromiseArray;
DS.PromiseObject = PromiseObject;

DS.PromiseManyArray = PromiseManyArray;
DS.RootState = RootState;
DS.InternalModel = InternalModel;
DS.Snapshot = Snapshot;

if (HAS_DEBUG_PACKAGE) {
  DS.DebugAdapter = require('@ember-data/debug').default;
}

DS.RecordArray = RecordArray;
DS.AdapterPopulatedRecordArray = AdapterPopulatedRecordArray;
DS.ManyArray = ManyArray;

DS.RecordArrayManager = RecordArrayManager;

DS.belongsTo = belongsTo;
DS.hasMany = hasMany;

DS.Relationship = Relationship;

DS._setupContainer = setupContainer;
DS.normalizeModelName = normalizeModelName;
=====================================


# maybe instead of doing Object.assign(model, {}); create a method that resets changes = {} and does the assign and maybe also creates lastRevisions

# intention:
# Sometimes CRUD operations dont create a new revision on returned data(?)(MemoryAdapter.update())
# CRUD operations should mutate the instance if provided as value

# Tracking tests:
# NOTE: do the same to a saved model(?) - do it in the insert test
# NOTE: do the same to a fetched and updated model - do it in the update test

# Relationships( + handle internal cleanRelationships())
# reasons for artifacts: doc gen, code cov report, .apk builds

try {
  let photo = PhotoComment.insert({ name: 'something' });
} catch (errors) {
  // let errors = [{ attribute: '', message: 'Doesn't look like a valid email.' }]
  // maybe add has interface later
  // PhotoComment.errorsFor(primaryKey);
  // - this should give the errors array
  // - it should be registered for errorTracker
  // - from the error one should be able to get the instance
  // - check also hbs templates
}

c8 -r html npm run test:node then upload to github pages(?)

.. maybe add errors.has(attr) and errors.remove(attr), errors.errorsFor(attr) AND
errors.add(attr, ['', '', '']);


to create dynamic className:
let Memoria = {};
Memoria['Foo'] = class { name = 'Izel' };
var me = new Memoria['Foo']() // Memoria.Foo{name: "Izel"}
console.log(me);










- TODO: I might want to make instances have .sortBy(), .mapBy() on array results
along with firstItem, lastItem/ extensions


- SQL Adapter tests
- Serializer interface
- push interface
- Consistent Error types and tests
- relationships
- Caching
- Maybe cache timeouts/intervals
- Check for instances(in all tests) and cache amounts in SQLAdapter

- MemoryAdapter should be able to handle string id/bigint columns for increment
- ORM should allow publickey and signatures as ids

make in build src adjust package.json main to dist or src based on clean or build script
- investigate relationship setting (!!)
- investigate error handling (!!)
- investigate changeset / repository / normal configuration
- investigate class-validator to ajv/JSON Schema exports (!!)
- investigate Adapter & Serializer interface




getters and instance method dont show on Object.keys etc Reflect.ownKeys



- investigate decorator validations
- maybe a more in-depth serializer

JS needs pipeline operator(|>) and cheap Rust bindings(JS<->Rust) and runtimes need to have ava API as default testing API(test.serial, test etc)

- investigate silent Errors within memoria.Server handler context
- make passthrough PASS
- add initializer.js
- memoria command shows options + loader + memoria browserify [dist] creates memoria.dist.js
- non-json request/responses? - just kidding... or do I?!?
- rollup -i ./lib/response.js -o response.js -f cjs
- memoria glue [jsonEndpoint]

// relationships declaration

import { cast, validateLength, validateRequired, foreignKeyConstraint } from 'memoria/changeset'; // instead use class-validator
import { from } from 'memoria/query';


// MODEL API:
import Model from 'memoria/model';

class User extends Model {
  Adapter: MemoryAdapter, // or SQLAdapter, JSONAPIAdapter, JSONAdapter, GraphQLAdapter
  Serializer: ModelSerializer // or JSONSerializer, JSONAPISerializer, GraphQLSerializer

  primaryKey = 'id' // or uuid or function(?)

  insert(options) {

  }
  update(options) {

  }
  delete(options) {

  }
  serializer(userOrUsers) {

  }
  serialize(user) {

  }
  resetDatabase(targetInitialState: object[]) {

  }

  // Model Query Interface:
  find(idOrIds) {

  }
  findBy(options) {

  }
  findAll(options) {

  }
  count(options) { // in memory, or in the resource through adapter with options?

  }

  // Extra examples: customAPIActions:
  confirm = APIAction({
    type: 'POST',
    before() {

    },
    after() {

    }
  })


  // private API: attributes, DB, defaultAttributes(string or lazy(with functions)) in future maybe as prop or decorator etc
  // maybe default App or DB validations expressed as decorators
}
Sketch:
User.insert({});

User { emails: hasManyProxy{}, firstName: 'Izel', lastName: 'Nakri' }

user.emails.then((emails) => {});

User.Adapter [sql, jsonapi, json, memory] , includes Repo reference, Repo setting at the beginning, synchronization strategies(later stage)
User.Serializer

User.findBy({}); => request

import { from, where, join, leftJoin, innerJoin } from 'memoria/query';

from()

Repo.one(query);
Repo.all(
